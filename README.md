## About <a name = "about"></a>

"ccpp" is a simple g++ interface made with python3, it is useful to run C/C++ code in only one command.<br>
So, instead of:<br>
`g++ example.cpp -o example`<br>
`./example`<br>
And sometimes you don't want the compiled file. So, you also do:<br>
`rm -rf example`<br>
All theses steps, can be reduced with ccpp to:<br>

```
ccpp example.cpp
```

And you will run your C/C++ code without (optionally) leaving a compiled file on the folder.<br>

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Install ccpp is very simple.

### Prerequisites

You will need python3 installed on your PC.<br>
For Python 3 installation, download on the [official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>

- Python 3 is already installed on the most linux distributions.<br>
  Try run "`python3`" on your shell.

As the ccpp is a g++ interface, you will need it installed too.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
